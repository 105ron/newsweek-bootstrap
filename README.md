# Using Twitter Bootstrap (with Newsweek)

This project's aim is to clone [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/) home page, a news publication built using bootstrap. It is an introduction to the popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

This is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) HTML/CSS track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/using-bootstrap) for more information.
